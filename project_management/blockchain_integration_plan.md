# Blockchain Integration Plan (Initial)

This document outlines the initial plan and considerations for integrating blockchain functionalities into the OpenTrade platform, primarily focusing on potential "Earn" or "Staking" features mentioned in user stories.

## Goals

- Explore possibilities for users to earn rewards through blockchain-based mechanisms (e.g., staking).
- Define how the platform backend would interact with relevant blockchains.
- Identify necessary components and potential challenges.

## Potential Integration Points (Phase 1 Focus: Planning Only)

1.  **Staking/Earn Features:**

    - **Concept:** Allow users to stake specific tokens (either native platform tokens if created later, or existing cryptocurrencies) via the platform interface to earn rewards.
    - **Interaction:**
      - The **Backend** would need to interact with specific smart contracts on the relevant blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana - TBD based on chosen staking mechanisms).
      - Interactions might include:
        - Querying staking contract details (APY, minimum stake, lockup periods).
        - Initiating stake transactions on behalf of the user (requires secure handling of user funds/keys - complex!).
        - Querying user's staked balance and earned rewards.
        - Initiating unstake/withdrawal transactions.
    - **Challenges:**
      - **Security:** Handling user private keys or managing funds for staking is extremely high-risk. A non-custodial approach (where the user initiates transactions from their own wallet connected via WalletConnect/MetaMask) is strongly preferred but adds frontend complexity. A custodial approach (platform manages funds) requires significant security infrastructure and regulatory compliance.
      - **Gas Fees:** Transactions on blockchains cost gas fees. The platform needs to decide how these are handled (passed to user, subsidized?).
      - **Smart Contract Risk:** Relying on external smart contracts introduces risks associated with those contracts (bugs, exploits).
      - **Blockchain Choice:** Different blockchains have different tools, costs, and speeds.

2.  **Reward Distribution:**

    - **Concept:** Distribute platform-generated rewards (e.g., from trading fee rebates, bot performance fees) to users via blockchain transactions.
    - **Interaction:** The **Backend** would need wallet capabilities to send tokens to user-provided wallet addresses on the appropriate blockchain.
    - **Challenges:** Requires managing a backend wallet with sufficient funds, handling transaction batching, monitoring transaction success/failure, and managing gas fees.

3.  **Wallet Connection (Future Consideration):**
    - **Concept:** Allow users to connect their existing non-custodial wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom) to the platform using standards like WalletConnect.
    - **Interaction:** Primarily a **Frontend** integration using libraries like `web3-react`, `ethers.js`, or specific wallet adapter libraries. The connected wallet address could be stored in the user profile.
    - **Use Cases:** Could be used for verifying ownership for certain features, initiating staking transactions (non-custodial), or receiving blockchain-based rewards directly.

## Proposed Phase 1 Approach

- **Focus on Planning:** Thoroughly research specific staking protocols or reward mechanisms that align with the platform's goals.
- **Prioritize Non-Custodial:** If blockchain interactions involving user funds are pursued, strongly favor non-custodial methods where users sign transactions via their own wallets connected to the frontend.
- **Backend Interface:** Define a clear interface within the **Backend/API Gateway** (`Blockchain Interface` component in architecture diagram) responsible for interacting with blockchain nodes/APIs (e.g., using Infura/Alchemy for RPC calls, or running a dedicated node).
- **Technology Selection:** Choose appropriate libraries (e.g., `ethers.js` for EVM chains) for backend interaction.
- **Defer Implementation:** Actual implementation of staking or direct blockchain transactions should likely be deferred beyond the initial core trading terminal functionality unless it's a primary MVP feature.

## Required Components (Conceptual)

- **Blockchain Service/Module (Backend):** Encapsulates logic for interacting with specific blockchains.
  - RPC communication (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).
  - Smart contract interaction (reading data, potentially sending transactions).
  - Wallet management (if platform needs to send transactions).
- **Wallet Connection Library (Frontend):** For non-custodial interactions (e.g., WalletConnect integration).

_This plan is high-level and requires significant further research and design based on specific feature decisions._

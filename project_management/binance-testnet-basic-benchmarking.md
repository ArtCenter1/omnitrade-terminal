# Binance Testnet Basic Benchmarking (Phase 1)

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for basic performance benchmarking of the Binance Testnet integration. This is Phase 1 of a two-phase benchmarking strategy, focusing on gathering essential metrics before proceeding with Order Management implementation.

## Objectives

1. Establish baseline performance metrics for key Binance Testnet API endpoints
2. Validate the effectiveness of our rate limit implementation
3. Identify any immediate performance concerns before proceeding with Order Management
4. Gather data to inform future scaling decisions

## Key Metrics to Measure

### REST API Performance (Priority Endpoints)

| Endpoint | Metrics to Measure | Sample Size |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Order Book (`/api/v3/depth`) | Response time, Size | 50 requests |
| Recent Trades (`/api/v3/trades`) | Response time | 50 requests |
| Ticker (`/api/v3/ticker/24hr`) | Response time | 50 requests |

### Rate Limit Utilization

| Metric | Description | How to Measure |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Weight Usage | Used weight out of 1200/minute | Track `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-1M` header |
| Weight Efficiency | Actual data received per weight unit | Calculate bytes/weight |
| Recovery Time | Time to reset after hitting limits | Measure time after 429 responses |

## Implementation Approach

1. **Performance Logging**:
   - Add timing wrappers to key methods in `BinanceTestnetAdapter`
   - Log request start/end times and response sizes
   - Track rate limit headers from responses

```typescript
// Example implementation for performance logging
private async measurePerformance<T>(
  endpoint: string,
  requestFn: () => Promise<T>
): Promise<T> {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  try {
    const result = await requestFn();
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    // Log performance metrics
    console.log(`[Performance] ${endpoint}: ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
    
    // Return the original result
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    const endTime = performance.now();
    console.error(`[Performance] ${endpoint} failed after ${endTime - startTime}ms:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Run benchmarks during normal development activities
   - Collect metrics in a simple CSV or JSON format
   - Focus on real-world usage patterns rather than synthetic tests

3. **Analysis**:
   - Calculate average, median, p95, and p99 response times
   - Identify endpoints with concerning performance
   - Document rate limit utilization patterns

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Performance Baseline Document**:
   - Response time metrics for key endpoints
   - Rate limit utilization patterns
   - Identified performance concerns (if any)

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Immediate optimizations (if needed)
   - Considerations for Order Management implementation
   - Preliminary scaling insights

## Timeline

- Implementation of performance logging: 0.5 day
- Data collection during development: 1-2 days (concurrent with other tasks)
- Analysis and documentation: 0.5 day

**Total dedicated time**: 1-2 developer days

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1 benchmarking and the MVP implementation, we will proceed to Phase 2 benchmarking, which includes:

1. Comprehensive benchmarking across all endpoints
2. Development of visualization components in the Admin Analytics page
3. Multi-user performance testing
4. Detailed optimization recommendations

Phase 2 is scheduled as a post-MVP activity in the project roadmap.

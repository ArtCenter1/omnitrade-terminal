# Plugin System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for the OmniTrade Terminal plugin system, which is a core feature of the platform.

## Overview

The OmniTrade Terminal plugin system enables developers to extend the functionality of the terminal through custom plugins. The architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and secure, allowing for a wide range of customizations while maintaining the stability of the core platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Plugin Registry

The Plugin Registry is the central repository for all installed plugins. It manages:

- Plugin registration and deregistration
- Plugin metadata storage
- Plugin dependency resolution
- Plugin version management
- Plugin state tracking (enabled/disabled)

### 2. Plugin Lifecycle Manager

The Plugin Lifecycle Manager controls the lifecycle of plugins, including:

- Plugin initialization
- Plugin loading and unloading
- Plugin activation and deactivation
- Plugin updates
- Error handling and recovery

### 3. Extension Points

Extension Points are well-defined interfaces that plugins can implement to extend specific areas of the terminal:

- **Component Extension Points**: Add new UI components to the terminal
- **Data Provider Extension Points**: Integrate with external data sources
- **Trading Extension Points**: Add new trading strategies or order types
- **Visualization Extension Points**: Add new chart types or indicators
- **Settings Extension Points**: Add plugin-specific settings to the settings panel

### 4. Plugin Manifest

Each plugin must include a manifest file (plugin.json) that defines:

- Plugin metadata (name, version, author, description)
- Required permissions
- Dependencies on other plugins
- Extension points implemented
- Configuration options
- Resource requirements

### 5. Plugin Sandbox

The Plugin Sandbox provides a secure execution environment for plugins, with:

- Resource limitations
- Access control to terminal APIs
- Isolation from other plugins
- Performance monitoring
- Error containment

## Plugin Development Workflow

1. **Create**: Developers use the Plugin SDK to create a new plugin project
2. **Develop**: Implement the desired functionality using the provided APIs
3. **Test**: Use the plugin testing utilities to validate functionality
4. **Package**: Bundle the plugin into a distributable format
5. **Publish**: Submit to the Plugin Marketplace or distribute privately
6. **Install**: Users install the plugin through the Terminal's plugin manager
7. **Configure**: Users configure the plugin through its settings interface
8. **Use**: The plugin extends the Terminal's functionality

## Security Considerations

- **Permission System**: Plugins must request specific permissions that users approve during installation
- **Code Signing**: Plugins in the marketplace must be signed by verified developers
- **Sandboxing**: Plugins run in a restricted environment with limited access to system resources
- **Versioning**: Plugins specify compatible Terminal versions to prevent compatibility issues
- **Review Process**: Marketplace plugins undergo a review process before publication

## Plugin SDK

The Plugin SDK provides developers with:

- Plugin templates for different extension types
- API documentation
- Development tools
- Testing utilities
- Packaging tools
- Example plugins

## Plugin Marketplace

The Plugin Marketplace allows users to:

- Browse available plugins
- View plugin ratings and reviews
- Install plugins directly from the marketplace
- Update installed plugins
- Report issues with plugins

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core plugin architecture and registry
2. **Phase 2**: Basic extension points for components and data providers
3. **Phase 3**: Plugin lifecycle management and sandboxing
4. **Phase 4**: Plugin SDK and developer documentation
5. **Phase 5**: Plugin Marketplace foundation

## Technical Specifications

### Plugin Manifest Example

```json
{
  "name": "advanced-indicators",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Trading Tools Inc.",
  "description": "Advanced technical indicators for chart analysis",
  "main": "index.js",
  "permissions": [
    "charts:read",
    "charts:write",
    "data:read"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "chart-utilities": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "extensionPoints": [
    "chart.indicator",
    "settings.panel"
  ],
  "compatibility": {
    "terminal": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Define detailed specifications for each extension point
2. Create the plugin registry implementation
3. Develop the plugin lifecycle management system
4. Design the plugin manifest schema
5. Implement the first set of extension points

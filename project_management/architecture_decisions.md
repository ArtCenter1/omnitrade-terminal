# Architecture Decisions Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the key architectural decisions made for the OpenTrade platform during Phase 1. For detailed information, please refer to the specific documents linked below.

## 1. Overall System Architecture

- **Pattern:** A modern web application architecture is adopted, likely involving a Single Page Application (SPA) frontend communicating with a backend API.
- **Deployment:** Initial focus on frontend development using Vite. Backend and deployment specifics are TBD but will likely involve containerization (e.g., Docker) and cloud hosting.
- **Details:** See `project_management/system_architecture.md`

## 2. Frontend Architecture

- **Framework:** React with TypeScript for type safety and component-based UI development.
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development builds and optimized production bundles.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, combined with shadcn/ui for pre-built, customizable components.
- **State Management:** (TBD - Likely React Context API for simpler state, potentially Zustand or Redux Toolkit for more complex global state if needed).
- **Component Structure:** Defined approach for organizing UI components.
- **Details:** See `project_management/component_structure.md`, `project_management/ui_component_library_design.md`, `project_management/color_scheme_typography.md`, `project_management/responsive_design_specifications.md`

## 3. Backend Architecture (Planned)

- **API Style:** RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.
- **Authentication:** Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) is planned.
- **Database:** Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) is assumed based on the schema design.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Specific integration points for token rewards and potentially on-chain actions are planned.
- **Details:** See `project_management/api_structure.md`, `project_management/authentication_flow.md`, `project_management/database_schema.md`, `project_management/blockchain_integration_plan.md`

## 4. Data Modeling & Relationships

- Core data entities (User, Bot, Market, Rewards) have been defined.
- Relationships between these entities have been mapped out to guide database design and API interactions.
- **Details:** See `project_management/data_model_*.md` files and `project_management/data_relationships.md`

## 5. Infrastructure & DevOps

- **CI/CD:** Basic CI pipeline configured using GitHub Actions for linting and potentially building/testing.
- **Details:** See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This summary captures the major architectural choices made so far. Further details and refinements will occur in subsequent phases.

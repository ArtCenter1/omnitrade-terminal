# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the OpenTrade platform, defining the quality attributes and constraints of the system.

## 1. Performance

- **P1 (Load Time):** The main application interfaces (Dashboard, Terminal) shall load within 2.5 seconds (Largest Contentful Paint) under typical network conditions (broadband). (Ref: Technical Requirements 3.1)
- **P2 (Interaction Latency):** User interface interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions, tab switching) shall provide visual feedback within 100ms. (Ref: Technical Requirements 3.2)
- **P3 (Real-time Data):** Real-time data displays (charts, order books, recent trades) shall update smoothly without noticeable UI stuttering or freezing. Data latency from the exchange should be minimized based on API capabilities. (Ref: Technical Requirements 3.3)
- **P4 (Resource Usage):** The application running in the browser shall not consume excessive CPU or memory resources under normal usage patterns.

## 2. Security

- **S1 (Authentication):** User authentication shall be secure, protecting against common vulnerabilities like credential stuffing and brute-force attacks. (Ref: Technical Requirements 4.1)
- **S2 (API Key Handling):** Exchange API keys provided by users shall be stored securely (encrypted at rest) and transmitted securely, never exposed directly to the frontend. (Ref: Technical Requirements 4.2)
- **S3 (Data Protection):** User data (profile information, trade history, etc.) shall be protected against unauthorized access.
- **S4 (Input Validation):** All inputs shall be validated to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks. (Ref: Technical Requirements 4.3)
- **S5 (Secure Communication):** All communication between the client and any backend services, and between backend services and exchanges, shall use secure protocols (HTTPS, WSS). (Ref: Technical Requirements 4.5)
- **S6 (Dependency Security):** Project dependencies shall be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities. (Ref: Technical Requirements 4.4)

## 3. Usability

- **U1 (Learnability):** New users should be able to understand the basic functions of the trading terminal and dashboard with minimal guidance.
- **U2 (Efficiency):** Experienced traders should be able to perform common tasks (e.g., placing orders, analyzing charts) efficiently.
- **U3 (Consistency):** The user interface shall be consistent in terms of layout, terminology, and interaction patterns across different sections of the application.
- **U4 (Error Prevention & Recovery):** The system should help users avoid errors (e.g., clear input formats, confirmations for critical actions). When errors occur, clear and informative messages should be displayed. (Ref: Technical Requirements 5.2)
- **U5 (Accessibility):** The application should strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards where feasible, including keyboard navigation and sufficient color contrast. (Ref: Coding Standards - Accessibility)

## 4. Reliability & Availability

- **R1 (Uptime):** The platform aims for high availability during market hours (specific target TBD, e.g., 99.9%).
- **R2 (Data Integrity):** Data displayed (e.g., portfolio balances, order status) shall accurately reflect the information from the connected exchanges, accounting for potential API delays.
- **R3 (Fault Tolerance):** The system should handle API errors or temporary unavailability of exchange connections gracefully, informing the user without crashing. (Ref: Technical Requirements 5.2)

## 5. Maintainability

- **M1 (Code Quality):** Code shall adhere to the defined coding standards, be well-structured, and include comments where necessary. (Ref: Technical Requirements 7.1, Coding Standards)
- **M2 (Modularity):** The application shall be designed with modular components to facilitate updates and feature additions. (Ref: Coding Standards - Modularity)
- **M3 (Testability):** Components and core logic shall be testable, with adequate unit and integration tests. (Ref: Technical Requirements 7.3)
- **M4 (Configurability):** Key parameters (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags) should be configurable where appropriate.

## 6. Scalability

- **SC1 (User Load):** The system architecture (especially any backend components) should be designed to handle a growing number of concurrent users in the future. (Ref: Technical Requirements 6.1)
- **SC2 (Exchange Support):** The architecture should allow for the addition of new exchange integrations without requiring major refactoring.

_These requirements will be reviewed and potentially refined throughout the project lifecycle._

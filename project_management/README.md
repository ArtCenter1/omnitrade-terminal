## Design Checkpoint Process

Before starting work on a new component or feature, review the Design Checkpoint document to ensure consistency and adherence to best practices. The Design Checkpoint Workflow document provides guidance on how to integrate this process into your development workflow.

This checkpoint process helps ensure:

- Consistency across implementations by different agents
- Proactive addressing of common challenges
- Adherence to architectural principles and best practices
- Comprehensive error handling and security considerations

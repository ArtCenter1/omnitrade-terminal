# Binance Testnet Integration Status

## Current Status

- **Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup & Authentication
- **Start Date**: [Current Date]
- **Target Completion**: [Current Date + 7 days]
- **Overall Progress**: 40%
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Required for core trading functionality

## Critical Context

The Binance Testnet integration is a **critical component** of the application for the following reasons:

- The application does not have a built-in matching engine
- Binance Testnet serves as our default matching engine for order execution
- Order placement testing is blocked until we successfully connect to Binance Testnet
- All trading functionality depends on this integration

## Recent Updates

- Created `BinanceTestnetAdapter` class extending `BaseExchangeAdapter`
- Updated configuration to include Binance Testnet endpoints
- Added feature flag for enabling Binance Testnet
- Updated `ExchangeFactory` to support Binance Testnet
- Modified `SandboxAdapter` to use Binance Testnet when enabled
- Created UI components for toggling and testing Binance Testnet feature
- Fixed browser compatibility issues with crypto module by using crypto-js

## Current Tasks (Prioritized)

- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Set up secure storage for API keys and secrets
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement API key validation test function
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Add clear connection status indicators in the UI
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Create guided setup process for API key configuration
- [x] Create configuration file for Binance Testnet endpoints
- [x] Create `BinanceTestnetAdapter` class extending `BaseExchangeAdapter`
- [x] Implement HMAC-SHA256 signature generation for API requests
- [x] Create authentication header builder function
- [x] Add timestamp and recvWindow parameters to requests

## Blockers

- Without proper API key management, users cannot test order placement functionality
- Trading functionality testing is blocked until Binance Testnet connection is established

## Next Steps (Reprioritized)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement secure API key storage and retrieval system
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete API key validation and connection testing
3. **HIGH**: Add UI indicators for Binance Testnet connection status
4. **HIGH**: Create guided setup process for API key configuration
5. **MEDIUM**: Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks (Setup & Authentication)
6. **MEDIUM**: Begin work on Phase 2 (Market Data Integration)
7. **LOW**: Schedule review meeting after critical functionality is implemented

## Notes

- Using existing Sandbox mode infrastructure to integrate with Binance Testnet
- Will need to ensure proper error handling for Testnet-specific issues
- Feature flag implemented to easily switch between mock data and Testnet
- **CRITICAL**: Binance Testnet is our default matching engine - without it, order placement testing is blocked
- **CRITICAL**: API key management is a top priority for enabling trading functionality
- **IMPORTANT**: Clear UI indicators needed to show when using mock data vs. connected to Testnet
- **IMPORTANT**: Consider implementing a guided setup wizard for new users to obtain and configure API keys

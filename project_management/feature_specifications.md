## Feature: Community & Leaderboards (Relates to Future User Stories)

### 1. Overview

Provide a dedicated "Community" page showcasing the performance of user-created trading bots via public leaderboards. This serves to foster community engagement, allow users to compare strategies, and act as a discovery mechanism for potential copy trading.

### 2. Requirements

- **Community Page:** Create a new top-level page/section accessible from the main navigation.
- **Bot Sharing Opt-In:**
  - Users must explicitly choose to make a specific bot's performance (backtest results or live trading) public for leaderboard inclusion.
  - This setting should be configurable per bot.
  - Clear indication of privacy implications when sharing.
- **Performance Tracking (Backend):**
  - **Backtests:** Store standardized results of backtests run on the platform, including configuration, duration, and key metrics (ROI, Drawdown, Win Rate, Profit Factor, etc.).
  - **Live Trading:** Continuously track the performance of _shared_ live bots. This requires recording trades executed by the bot, calculating P/L, and deriving metrics over time. Data needs to be aggregated periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) for leaderboard display.
  - _Requires significant data model updates (e.g., `shared_bots`, `bot_performance_snapshots`, `backtest_results` tables/collections)._
- **Leaderboards Display:**
  - Display two distinct leaderboards side-by-side on the Community page:
    - **Backtest Leaderboard:** Ranks bots based on their historical backtest performance.
    - **Live Trade Leaderboard:** Ranks currently running (or recently active) shared bots based on their live trading performance.
  - Each leaderboard should display key information for each ranked bot:
    - Rank
    - Bot Name (User-defined)
    - Strategy Type (e.g., GRID, DCA)
    - Market Pair
    - Key Performance Metric (e.g., ROI%, Profit Factor - configurable sort?)
    - Duration (Backtest period or Live trading duration)
    - Creator Username/Alias (Optional, user configurable?)
    - Link to view more detailed bot performance (Future feature)
    - "Copy" button/indicator (Future feature - links to copy trading setup)
- **Filtering & Sorting:**
  - Allow users to filter leaderboards by Strategy Type, Market Pair, Timeframe (for live performance, e.g., 7d, 30d, 90d, All-time).
  - Allow users to sort leaderboards by different performance metrics (ROI, Profit Factor, etc.).
- **Data Freshness:** Indicate when the leaderboard data was last updated. Live leaderboard data should be updated reasonably frequently (e.g., hourly or daily).
- **Landing Page Preview:**
  - Display a preview section of a leaderboard (e.g., Top 3-5 Live Bots by ROI%) on the main public landing page.
  - This section should highlight key attractive metrics (e.g., ROI, Win Rate).
  - Include a clear Call to Action (CTA) linking to the full Community page or registration.
  - Requires a dedicated public API endpoint to fetch this preview data without authentication.

### 3. UI Elements

- Community Page Layout (potentially two columns for leaderboards).
- Leaderboard Table Component (reusable for both backtest and live).
- Filtering controls (Dropdowns, buttons).
- Sorting controls (Clickable table headers).
- Pagination for leaderboards if they become long.
- Bot sharing toggle/checkbox within the bot configuration UI.
- Landing Page Leaderboard Preview Component.

### 4. Data Model Considerations

- Need new tables/collections to store shared bot status, backtest results, and aggregated live performance snapshots.
- Need to define standardized performance metrics and calculation logic.
- User profile settings might need additions for public alias/sharing preferences.

### 5. Copy Trading Link

- The leaderboards are the primary source for users to find bots they might want to copy. The UI should facilitate this transition once copy trading is implemented (e.g., via a "Copy" button).

### 6. Error Handling

- Display appropriate messages if leaderboard data cannot be loaded.
- Handle cases where a user stops sharing a bot (it should be removed from the live leaderboard).

## Feature: AI-Driven Trading (Relates to Future User Stories & Roadmap Phase 5)

### 1. Overview

Introduce AI capabilities into the platform, offering both pre-built AI-powered trading strategies provided by OpenTrade and allowing advanced users to integrate their own external AI models/signals via API ("Bring Your Own AI" - BYOAI). This feature aims to attract users interested in cutting-edge trading automation.

### 2. Requirements

- **Landing Page Introduction:**
  - Add a dedicated section on the public landing page introducing the AI trading capabilities.
  - Briefly explain the concept of platform AI bots and the BYOAI feature.
  - Highlight potential benefits (e.g., advanced signal processing, adaptive strategies).
  - Include a Call to Action (CTA) encouraging users to sign up to access these features.
- **Platform AI Bots (Post-MVP/Later Phase):**
  - Develop and offer a selection of pre-built trading bots powered by AI/ML models (e.g., sentiment analysis, predictive models).
  - Users can browse, select, configure (limited parameters), and deploy these bots similar to standard strategy bots.
  - Performance and configuration details for these specific AI models need definition.
  - Requires significant backend AI model development/integration and infrastructure.
- **Custom AI Integration (BYOAI) (Post-MVP/Later Phase):**
  - **API Endpoint for Signals:** Provide a secure API endpoint within the OpenTrade platform for users' external AI models to send trading signals (e.g., BUY, SELL, HOLD, specific order parameters).
  - **Signal Definition:** Define a clear and standardized format for incoming API signals (e.g., JSON payload specifying market pair, action, quantity/percentage, optional price limits, unique signal ID).
  - **Authentication:** Secure the API endpoint using user-specific API keys generated within the platform.
  - **Bot Configuration:** Create a new "Custom AI Signal" bot type in the bot configuration UI.
    - Users select this type when creating a bot.
    - Users configure the market pair, exchange account, risk parameters (e.g., max position size, capital allocation).
    - The UI displays the dedicated API endpoint URL and allows the user to generate/manage API keys for this specific bot/signal source.
  - **Signal Execution:** When the platform receives a valid signal via the API endpoint for a configured BYOAI bot, it translates the signal into the corresponding trade order(s) and executes them on the user's linked exchange account, respecting the bot's risk parameters.
  - **Logging & Monitoring:** Log all incoming signals, validation results, and resulting trade executions for user visibility and debugging.
- **Dedicated AI Section (Authenticated App):**
  - Create a new section/page within the authenticated application dedicated to AI Trading.
  - This section would list available Platform AI Bots (when implemented).
  - This section would provide the interface for configuring BYOAI bots and managing their API keys/endpoints.

### 3. UI Elements

- Landing Page AI Introduction Section Component.
- Authenticated App:
  - AI Trading main page/section.
  - Configuration UI for "Custom AI Signal" bot type.
  - Display area for BYOAI API endpoint URL and key management.
  - (Future) Cards/Listings for Platform AI Bots.
  - Monitoring view for BYOAI signal logs and executions.

### 4. Data Model Considerations

- Extend `trading_bots` table/model to include `strategyType = 'CUSTOM_AI_SIGNAL'`.
- Need a new table/collection to store API keys associated with BYOAI bots (`ai_signal_api_keys`?).
- Need a table/collection to log incoming AI signals (`ai_signal_logs`?).
- (Future) Need models for Platform AI Bot definitions and configurations.

### 5. Backend Considerations

- Implement the secure API endpoint for receiving external AI signals.
- Develop the logic to validate incoming signals against bot configuration and user permissions.
- Implement the signal-to-trade execution translation layer.
- Develop API key generation and management functionality.
- (Future) Develop/integrate platform AI models.

### 6. Error Handling

- Provide clear error responses for invalid API signals (bad format, invalid key, unknown bot, etc.).
- Log errors during signal processing or trade execution.
- Notify users (optional) of persistent signal failures or execution issues.

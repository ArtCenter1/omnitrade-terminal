# Documentation Standards

This document defines the standards and guidelines for documentation across the OpenTrade project, including code comments, commit messages, and project management documents (like those in `/project_management`). Consistent and clear documentation is essential for maintainability, collaboration, and onboarding.

## 1. General Principles

- **Clarity:** Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon where possible or explain it if necessary.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure documentation reflects the current state of the code or plan. Update documentation when changes are made.
- **Completeness:** Provide enough detail for the intended audience to understand the subject matter.
- **Consistency:** Follow the defined standards consistently across the project.
- **Audience:** Consider the intended audience (e.g., fellow developers, future self, non-technical stakeholders) and tailor the level of detail accordingly.

## 2. Code Comments

- **Purpose:** Explain _why_ something is done, not just _what_ it does (the code itself should explain the _what_). Explain complex logic, workarounds, or non-obvious decisions.
- **Language:** English.
- **Style:**
  - Use standard comment syntax for the language (e.g., `//` or `/* ... */` in TypeScript/JavaScript).
  - Use JSDoc/TSDoc comments for functions, classes, interfaces, and complex types to enable better tooling support (intellisense, documentation generation).
  - ```typescript
    /**
     * Calculates the total value based on items and a discount rate.
     * @param items - The list of items to process.
     * @param discountRate - The discount rate to apply (e.g., 0.1 for 10%).
     * @returns The calculated total value.
     */
    function calculateValue(items: Item[], discountRate: number): number {
      // Complex calculation logic explained here...
      return total;
    }
    ```
- **Avoid:**
  - Commenting obvious code.
  - Leaving commented-out code blocks without explanation. Remove dead code instead.
  - Writing comments that contradict the code.

## 3. Commit Messages

- **Standard:** Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- **Format:**

  ```
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]
  ```

- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.
- **Scope:** Optional, indicates the part of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `bots`, `api`).
- **Description:** Imperative mood, present tense (e.g., "add login form", not "added login form" or "adds login form"). Keep it concise (<= 50 chars recommended).
- **Body:** Optional, provides more context, explains the _why_ behind the change. Use multiple paragraphs if needed.
- **Footer:** Optional, used for referencing issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #123`) or breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE: ...`).
- **Example:**

  ```
  feat(auth): add password reset functionality

  Implement the complete password reset flow including request endpoint,
  email sending, token verification, and password update endpoint.

  Fixes #45
  ```

## 4. Project Management Documents (`/project_management`)

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`).
- **Style:**
  - Use clear headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure content.
  - Use lists (bulleted or numbered) for clarity.
  - Use code blocks (```) for code examples or configuration snippets.
  - Use tables for structured data where appropriate.
  - Link related documents where necessary (e.g., `See [API Structure](api_structure.md)`).
- **File Naming:** Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores separating words (e.g., `data_model_user.md`).
- **Maintenance:** Keep documents up-to-date as plans evolve or decisions change. Mark outdated sections clearly if they cannot be immediately updated.

## 5. README Files

- The main `README.md` should provide a project overview, setup instructions, and key information (as defined in the updated root README).
- Subdirectories may contain their own `README.md` files to explain the purpose and contents of that specific directory, if necessary.

By adhering to these standards, we aim to maintain a high quality of documentation throughout the OpenTrade project lifecycle.

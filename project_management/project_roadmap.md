## Redis Cloud Setup

Before proceeding to Phase 6, the platform needs a proper Redis cloud setup for production and live testing environments. Currently, Redis runs locally and requires manual startup after system restart, which is not suitable for production use.

Refer to [Redis Cloud Roadmap](redis_cloud_roadmap.md) for detailed implementation steps, timeline, and cost considerations. This setup is critical for ensuring reliable:
- Market data caching
- API rate limiting
- Job queuing for trading bots

## Phase 6: Blockchain Integration

- Implement wallet integration
- Develop reward distribution system
- Create referral tracking system
- Build code contribution tracking
- Implement token utility features

## Phase 7: Testing and Optimization

- Implement unit tests
- Conduct integration testing
- Perform security audits
- Optimize performance
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Fix bugs and issues
- Optimize for different devices and browsers

## Phase 8: Deployment and Launch

- Deploy to production environment
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Create user documentation
- Implement analytics
- Develop marketing website
- Create onboarding materials
- Launch beta version

## Phase 9: Post-Launch Improvements

- Collect and analyze user feedback
- Implement high-priority improvements
- Fix production issues
- Add additional features based on user requests

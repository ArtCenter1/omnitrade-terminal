# Technical Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements and constraints for the OpenTrade platform.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React (v18+) with TypeScript
- **UI Library:** shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v3+)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **State Management:** React Context API / Hooks initially. Evaluate Zustand or Redux if complexity increases significantly.
- **Routing:** React Router (v6+)
- **Charting Library:** TradingView Lightweight Charts / Widget
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier (as configured)
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Version Control:** Git
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## 2. Target Platforms & Environment

- **Primary Target:** Modern Desktop Web Browsers (Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Responsiveness:** The application must be responsive and usable on common desktop resolutions (e.g., 1280px width and above). Mobile/Tablet responsiveness is a secondary goal for Phase 1 but should be considered in component design.
- **Node.js Version (for development/build):** Use Node.js LTS version (currently v20.x).

## 3. Performance

- **Load Time:** Initial page load (Dashboard/Terminal) should strive for a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- **Responsiveness (Interaction):** UI interactions (button clicks, form submissions, chart interactions) should feel responsive, ideally with feedback within 100ms.
- **Real-time Data:** Real-time data feeds (chart, order book, trades) should update efficiently without causing significant UI lag or excessive resource consumption. WebSockets preferred where available from exchanges.
- **Bundle Size:** Keep the production JavaScript bundle size optimized through code splitting and efficient dependency management. Aim to keep the initial vendor chunk reasonably small.

## 4. Security

- **Authentication:** Implement secure user authentication (details TBD in authentication flow design). Store credentials securely (e.g., hashed passwords). Consider JWT or session-based authentication.
- **API Keys:** User exchange API keys must be handled securely. They should ideally be stored encrypted at rest and transmitted securely. Avoid storing them in frontend code or local storage. Consider a secure backend proxy/service for handling exchange interactions.
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs must be validated on both the client-side and server-side (if applicable) to prevent injection attacks (XSS, etc.).
- **Dependencies:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit`).
- **HTTPS:** The application must be served over HTTPS in production.

## 5. API Integrations

- **Exchange APIs:** Integrate with exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, KuCoin - specific list TBD) for market data, order placement, and account information.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls, including handling rate limits, network errors, and exchange-specific errors. Provide clear feedback to the user.
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect exchange API rate limits. Implement appropriate throttling or queuing if necessary.

## 6. Scalability (Future Consideration)

- While Phase 1 focuses on core functionality, the architecture should allow for future scaling (e.g., handling more users, supporting more exchanges, adding more complex features).
- Consider statelessness where possible for backend services (if developed).

## 7. Code Quality & Maintainability

- Adhere to the defined `coding_standards.md`.
- Code should be well-commented where logic is complex.
- Maintain reasonable test coverage for critical components and logic.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date.

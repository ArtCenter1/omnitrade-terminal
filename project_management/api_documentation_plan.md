# API Documentation Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating and maintaining documentation for the OpenTrade backend API. Clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date API documentation is crucial for frontend development, potential third-party integrations, and long-term maintainability.

## 1. Goals

- Provide a clear reference for frontend developers consuming the API.
- Ensure consistency and accuracy in API usage.
- Facilitate onboarding of new developers.
- Potentially serve as a basis for public API documentation if needed in the future.

## 2. Documentation Standard & Format

- **Standard:** [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/specification/) (Version 3.x) will be used as the standard format for describing the RESTful API.
- **Format:** Documentation will be written in YAML or JSON format conforming to the OAS. YAML is preferred for readability.

## 3. Generation Method

- **Approach:** Code-first approach using annotations/decorators within the backend codebase (language/framework dependent, e.g., using libraries like `swagger-jsdoc` for Node.js/Express, `drf-spectacular` for Django REST Framework, or similar tools for other stacks).
- **Rationale:** This approach keeps the documentation tightly coupled with the implementation, reducing the likelihood of documentation becoming outdated. The OAS file(s) will be automatically generated from the code annotations during the build or a specific documentation generation step.

## 4. Content Requirements

Each API endpoint documentation should include:

- **Path & Method:** The URL path and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- **Summary & Description:** A brief summary and a more detailed description of the endpoint's purpose.
- **Tags:** Grouping endpoints by resource or functionality (e.g., `Auth`, `Users`, `Bots`, `MarketData`).
- **Parameters:**
  - Path parameters (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
  - Query parameters (e.g., `?status=active`).
  - Request headers (e.g., `Authorization`).
  - For each parameter: name, location (path, query, header), data type, required status, description, and example.
- **Request Body:** (For POST, PUT, PATCH)
  - Description of the expected request payload.
  - Schema definition (using OAS schema objects) detailing fields, data types, required status, and examples.
  - Content type (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Responses:**
  - For each possible HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500):
    - Description of the response scenario.
    - Response headers (if applicable).
    - Response body schema definition (using OAS schema objects) with examples.
    - Content type (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Security:** Definition of security schemes used (e.g., JWT Bearer token) and which endpoints require authentication/authorization.
- **Schemas:** Reusable schema definitions for common data structures (e.g., `User`, `TradingBot`, `ErrorResponse`) referenced in request/response bodies.

## 5. Tools & Hosting

- **Generation:** Backend framework-specific libraries (TBD based on backend language choice).
- **Rendering/UI:** [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) will be used to render the generated OAS file into interactive HTML documentation.
- **Hosting:** The rendered HTML documentation will be hosted alongside the application (potentially served by the backend itself under a `/api-docs` path or deployed as a static site). Access control might be needed depending on whether it's internal or public.

## 6. Maintenance Process

- API documentation annotations must be updated _concurrently_ with API code changes.
- Code reviews should include checks for documentation accuracy and completeness.
- The CI/CD pipeline could include a step to validate the generated OAS file and potentially fail the build if documentation is missing or invalid for new/modified endpoints.

This plan establishes the foundation for creating robust API documentation once the backend development commences.

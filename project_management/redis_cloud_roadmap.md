# Redis Cloud Setup Roadmap

## Current Status

The OmniTrade platform currently uses Redis for:
- Caching market data
- Rate limiting API requests
- Job queuing for trading bots (via BullMQ)

In the development environment, Redis runs locally on the developer's machine. After system restart, the Redis container needs to be manually started.

## Problem

For live testing and production deployment, a local Redis instance is not suitable because:
1. It requires the developer's machine to be running 24/7
2. It's not accessible from cloud-deployed applications
3. It lacks proper security, backup, and scaling capabilities

## Roadmap for Cloud Redis Setup

### Phase 1: Research and Selection (1-2 days)

1. **Evaluate Redis Cloud Providers**:
   - AWS ElastiCache for Redis
   - Azure Cache for Redis
   - Google Cloud Memorystore
   - Redis Enterprise Cloud
   - Upstash (serverless Redis)

2. **Selection Criteria**:
   - Cost (including free tier options)
   - Performance
   - Ease of setup and management
   - Security features
   - Backup and recovery options
   - Scaling capabilities

### Phase 2: Account Setup and Provisioning (1 day)

1. **Create Cloud Provider Account**:
   - Sign up for the selected cloud provider
   - Set up billing information
   - Configure access controls

2. **Provision Redis Instance**:
   - Create a Redis instance with appropriate size
   - Configure memory, connections, and other parameters
   - Set up security (authentication, network access)
   - Note connection details

### Phase 3: Application Configuration (1-2 days)

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Update `REDIS_URL` in backend/.env to point to cloud Redis
   - Ensure proper authentication is included in the URL

2. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Verify the application can connect to cloud Redis
   - Test basic operations (get, set, etc.)
   - Monitor for connection issues

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document the Redis cloud setup
   - Update deployment instructions

### Phase 4: Deployment and Testing (2-3 days)

1. **Deploy Backend to Cloud**:
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud provider
   - Configure it to use the cloud Redis instance

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test application performance with cloud Redis
   - Monitor Redis metrics (memory usage, connections, etc.)
   - Adjust Redis parameters if needed

3. **Security Review**:
   - Ensure Redis connection is secure
   - Review network access controls
   - Verify data encryption

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance (Ongoing)

1. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Configure alerts for Redis issues
   - Monitor Redis performance metrics
   - Set up logging for Redis operations

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Configure regular backups
   - Test restore procedures
   - Document disaster recovery process

3. **Scaling Plan**:
   - Determine when to scale Redis
   - Document scaling procedures
   - Plan for cost management

## Estimated Timeline

- **Total Setup Time**: 5-8 days
- **Prerequisites**: Cloud provider account with billing information

## Cost Considerations

- Many cloud providers offer free tiers for Redis:
  - AWS: Free tier includes 750 hours of t2.micro Redis node per month for 12 months
  - Google Cloud: $300 free credit for new users
  - Azure: Free tier includes $200 credit for new users
  - Upstash: Free tier with 100MB storage and 10K daily commands

- Production costs will depend on:
  - Memory size
  - Number of connections
  - Data transfer
  - High availability requirements

## Next Steps

1. Complete the application modifications to make Redis optional or gracefully handle Redis failures
2. Research and select a cloud provider
3. Begin the setup process once cloud provider account is established

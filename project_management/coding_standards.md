# Project Coding Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices to be followed for the OpenTrade project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures code consistency, readability, maintainability, and quality.

## General Principles

- **Readability:** Write code that is easy for others (and your future self) to understand. Use meaningful variable and function names. Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code.
- **Consistency:** Follow the established patterns and conventions used throughout the project.
- **Simplicity (KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer simple solutions over complex ones whenever possible.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Use functions, components, and utilities to encapsulate reusable logic.
- **Modularity:** Break down complex features into smaller, manageable components and modules.Keep files under 500 lines. Split into modules when needed.

## Language Specific

### TypeScript

- **Typing:** Use TypeScript's static typing features extensively. Define interfaces or types for props, state, API responses, and complex objects. Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary and provide justification.
- **ESLint/Prettier:** Rely on the configured ESLint and Prettier setup (to be done) to enforce code style and catch potential errors. Ensure code is formatted correctly before committing.
- **Modules:** Use ES6 module syntax (`import`/`export`).

### React

- **Functional Components:** Prefer functional components with Hooks over class components.
- **Component Naming:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`).
- **Props:** Use clear and descriptive prop names. Destructure props in the function signature. Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces.
- **State Management:** Use `useState` for simple component state. For more complex state or shared state, consider `useReducer`, Context API, or a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux) if the need arises.
- **Hooks:** Follow the Rules of Hooks (call Hooks only at the top level, call Hooks only from React functions). Create custom Hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic.
- **Keys:** Always provide stable and unique `key` props when rendering lists of elements. Avoid using array indices as keys if the list can change order or size.
- **File Structure:** Organize components logically, potentially by feature or type (e.g., `components/ui`, `components/dashboard`, `pages`).

### CSS / Tailwind CSS

- **Utility-First:** Embrace Tailwind's utility-first approach. Apply styles directly in the JSX using utility classes.
- **Readability:** Group related utility classes together (e.g., layout, typography, background, borders).
- **Customization:** Use the `tailwind.config.ts` file to customize theme values (colors, spacing, fonts) rather than arbitrary values in classes.
- **Component Classes:** For complex, reusable UI elements that require many utilities, consider using `@apply` in a CSS file or creating dedicated UI components (like those from shadcn/ui) that encapsulate the styles.
- **Responsiveness:** Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to create adaptive layouts.

## Git and Version Control

- **Branching:** Use a feature branching workflow (e.g., Gitflow or GitHub Flow). Create descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-user-login`, `fix/chart-rendering-bug`).
- **Commits:** Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow the conventional commit format if adopted. Make small, atomic commits.
- **Pull Requests:** Use pull requests for code review before merging into main branches. Provide clear descriptions of the changes.

## Accessibility (a11y)

- **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons, `<nav>` for navigation).
- **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes where necessary to improve accessibility for screen readers, especially for custom components.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.
- **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background according to WCAG guidelines.

## Performance

- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` judiciously to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially in performance-critical sections. Profile before optimizing.
- **Code Splitting:** Utilize code splitting (e.g., with `React.lazy` and Suspense) to load components or pages on demand, reducing initial bundle size.
- **Bundle Size:** Be mindful of dependencies added to the project. Analyze bundle size periodically.

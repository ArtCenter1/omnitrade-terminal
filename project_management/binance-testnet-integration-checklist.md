# Binance Testnet Integration Checklist

## Critical Context

**IMPORTANT**: The Binance Testnet integration is a critical component of our application:

- We do not have a built-in matching engine
- Binance Testnet serves as our default matching engine
- Order placement testing is blocked until we successfully connect to Binance Testnet
- All trading functionality depends on this integration

## Prerequisites (CRITICAL)

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Binance Testnet account created
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: API keys generated and secured
- [ ] Testnet endpoints documented (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Rate limits understood and documented
- [ ] Existing Sandbox mode functionality reviewed (COMPLETED)

## Phase 1: Setup & Authentication (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Critical Path Items (MUST COMPLETE FIRST)

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Environment variables set up for API keys and secrets
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Secure storage implemented for API keys
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Connection status tracking implemented with clear UI indicators

# Current Project Phase

The project is now in the "Frontend-Backend Integration" phase. The primary focus is connecting the core frontend components—User Profile/Settings, Dashboard, and Terminal—to the backend services. This phase aims to enable seamless data flow and user interaction across the application.

Detailed tasks and progress for this phase are tracked in [`frontend_backend_integration_checklist.md`](./frontend_backend_integration_checklist.md).

## Next Step

**Implement backend API endpoints for user exchange API key management**

The first actionable step is to design and build backend API endpoints for managing user exchange API keys. This includes functionality to add, list, delete, and test connection/credentials for exchange API keys. These endpoints do not currently exist and must be implemented from scratch.

This foundational work will enable secure integration between user accounts and external exchanges, supporting future trading and data features.

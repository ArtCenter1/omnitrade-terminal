# Design Checkpoint: Crypto Trading Platform Architecture

This document serves as a design checkpoint for the OmniTrade crypto trading platform. It provides an assessment of the current architecture, identifies potential challenges, and offers recommendations for ensuring consistency and best practices throughout development.

## Purpose

This checkpoint should be reviewed:

1. Before starting work on a new component or feature
2. When integrating work from different agents
3. During regular architecture reviews
4. When encountering technical challenges

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Core Components

The OmniTrade platform consists of these key components:

1. **Frontend Application**

   - React/TypeScript-based UI with shadcn/ui components
   - Dashboard, Terminal, Bot Management, and other key pages
   - Authentication UI with Firebase integration

2. **Backend API Gateway**

   - NestJS-based REST API
   - Authentication and authorization with JWT
   - Integration with Prisma ORM

3. **Exchange Connectivity Layer**

   - Exchange API key management
   - CCXT library integration for exchange operations
   - Secure credential storage

4. **Market Data System**

   - CoinGecko API integration for market data
   - Redis caching for performance optimization
   - WebSocket gateway for real-time updates

5. **Trading Bot Engine**

   - Bot scheduler using cron-based timing
   - Bot executor with error handling and recovery
   - Performance tracking and state management

6. **Database Layer**

   - Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
   - Well-defined schema for users, bots, and trading data
   - Migration system for schema evolution

7. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis for market data and API response caching
   - In-memory caching for frequently accessed data

### Strengths

1. **Well-Defined Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and bot execution.

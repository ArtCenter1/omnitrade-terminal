## Development Guidelines

### Continuity Between Sessions

To maintain continuity between development sessions:

1. **Check the Current Phase** - Always refer to `project_management/current_phase.md` to understand the current focus and next steps.

2. **Update Reference Files** - When working on a feature, update its reference file with progress, challenges, and next steps.

3. **Follow the Roadmap** - Refer to `project_management/project_roadmap.md` to ensure development aligns with the overall plan.

### Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript code
- Follow the established component structure
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
- Implement responsive design for all UI components
- Write descriptive comments and maintain documentation

### Dependencies Management

- All dependencies should be documented and justified
- Major dependencies should be noted in reference files
- Version constraints should be specified and explained

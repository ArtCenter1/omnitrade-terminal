## 2025-05-15 - Hardcoded Encryption Keys and Static IVs
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded encryption keys (`super_secret_key`) and static Initialization Vectors (all zeros) were used in `ExchangeApiKeyService` and `PortfolioService` to "encrypt" sensitive exchange API keys and secrets.
**Learning:** This implementation provided only a false sense of security (security theater). A static IV means the same plaintext always results in the same ciphertext, and a hardcoded key is easily discoverable by anyone with access to the source code.
**Prevention:** Always use environment-driven secrets for encryption keys and ensure each encryption operation uses a unique, random IV. Store the IV alongside the ciphertext.

# Active Context: OmniTrade Terminal

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on completing Phase 1 of the OmniTrade Terminal, with an emphasis on the core terminal foundation, extension points, plugin system, and essential trading components.

## Recent Changes
1. Established the foundation of the Memory Bank with key documentation files.
2. Defined the project brief, product context, technical context, and system patterns.
3. Implemented extension point interfaces (data provider, command, menu, settings).
4. Developed the plugin system architecture (manifest schema, loading mechanism, sandbox).

## Next Steps
1. Complete the Core Terminal UI Development (theme support, global styling, terminal header/footer).
2. Begin implementing Essential Terminal Components (chart, order book, order entry).
3. Develop the Data Service Layer for market data and trading operations.
4. Set up testing framework and create tests for core components.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. The project is following a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
2. TypeScript is being used throughout the project for both frontend and backend to maintain consistency and leverage its type safety benefits.
3. The terminal uses a component-based architecture with extension points for plugins.
4. The plugin system provides a sandbox environment for secure plugin execution.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. The project adheres to a consistent coding standard enforced by ESLint and Prettier.
2. Extension points follow the singleton pattern for global access.
3. The plugin system uses a manifest-based approach for plugin metadata and dependencies.
4. UI components are designed to be draggable and configurable in the workspace.

## Learnings and Insights
1. The importance of maintaining comprehensive documentation for a complex project like OmniTrade Terminal.
2. The need for a robust and scalable architecture to handle high-volume trading data and user interactions.
3. The value of using modern web technologies and frameworks to enhance development efficiency and application performance.
4. The benefits of a well-designed extension system for future expandability.

This active context document serves as a living record of the current state of the OmniTrade Terminal project, guiding immediate development efforts and informing future decisions.

# System Patterns: OmniTrade Terminal

## Architecture Overview
The OmniTrade Terminal follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and external integrations.

## Key System Patterns
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilized for handling real-time market data and trading events.
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Backend services are designed to be independent and scalable.
3. **Repository Pattern**: Used for database interactions to maintain a clear separation between business logic and data access.
4. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented for real-time updates and notifications.

## Component Interactions
1. Frontend (React) communicates with Backend (NestJS) via REST API and WebSocket connections.
2. Backend services interact with databases (PostgreSQL, Redis) for data storage and retrieval.
3. External integrations (e.g., Binance Testnet API) are handled through dedicated service modules.

## Data Flow
1. Market data is ingested through WebSocket connections and REST APIs from exchanges.
2. Data is processed and stored in the database for historical analysis.
3. Real-time data is cached in Redis for fast access.
4. Frontend receives real-time updates through WebSocket connections.

## Scalability Patterns
1. Horizontal scaling of backend services using containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
2. Database scaling through PostgreSQL replication and sharding techniques.
3. Caching layer (Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.

## Security Patterns
1. Authentication: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
2. Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented using middleware.
3. Data Encryption: TLS for data in transit, encryption at rest for sensitive user data.

## Monitoring and Logging
1. Logging: Centralized logging using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
2. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics and performance monitoring.

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API integrations.
2. Introduce load testing and chaos engineering practices.
3. Enhance security with additional measures like rate limiting and IP blocking.

This system patterns document provides insight into the architectural decisions and design patterns used in the OmniTrade Terminal, guiding future development and maintenance efforts.

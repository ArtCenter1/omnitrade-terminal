# System Patterns: OmniTrade

## Architecture Overview

OmniTrade follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Key Components

1. Frontend: React-based user interface
2. Backend: Node.js with NestJS framework
3. Exchange Adapters: Separate modules for each exchange API integration
4. Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
5. Real-time Data: WebSocket-based market data feed

## Design Patterns

1. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for backend services
2. Repository Pattern for database interactions
3. Adapter Pattern for exchange API integrations

## Data Flow

1. User interactions handled by Frontend
2. Frontend communicates with Backend via REST API
3. Backend processes requests, interacts with Database and Exchange Adapters
4. Real-time market data received through WebSocket connections

## Scalability Considerations

1. Containerization using Docker
2. Orchestration with Kubernetes
3. Load balancing for high availability

## Security Measures

1. OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
2. JWT tokens for session management
3. Encryption for sensitive data

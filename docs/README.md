# OmniTrade Documentation & GitHub Pages

This directory contains essential documentation for the OmniTrade project and serves as the GitHub Pages site. For more comprehensive documentation, please visit our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ArtCenter1/omnitrade/wiki).

## GitHub Pages

This folder now also hosts the GitHub Pages site for the OmniTrade Terminal. The following files are part of the GitHub Pages deployment:

- `index.html` - The main landing page
- `test.html` - A test page to verify GitHub Pages is working
- `404.html` - Custom 404 error page
- `.nojekyll` - Tells GitHub Pages not to process this site with Jekyll

## In-Project Documentation

These files are kept within the project repository for easy access by developers and AI coding agents:

- [Coding Standards](./CODING_STANDARDS.md) - Coding conventions and best practices
- [Architecture Overview](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Environment Setup](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) - Quick guide to setting up the development environment
- [UI Guidelines](./UI_GUIDELINES.md) - Essential UI/UX guidelines and principles

## Comprehensive Documentation

For more detailed documentation, please visit our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ArtCenter1/omnitrade/wiki), which includes:

- Detailed Getting Started Guide
- Complete Environment Configuration
- Development Workflows
- Comprehensive UI/UX Guidelines
- API Reference

## Project Management

For roadmap, sprint planning, and task tracking, please visit our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/yourusername/omnitrade/projects).

## Documentation Strategy

We use a hybrid documentation approach:

1. **In-Project Documentation** (this directory): Essential information needed during development
2. **GitHub Wiki**: Comprehensive documentation for human developers
3. **GitHub Projects**: Project management, roadmap, and task tracking

This ensures that both human developers and AI coding agents have access to the information they need.

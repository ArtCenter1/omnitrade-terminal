## Documentation Strategy

We use a hybrid documentation approach:

1. **In-Project Documentation** (this directory): Essential information needed during development
2. **GitHub Wiki**: Comprehensive documentation for human developers
3. **GitHub Projects**: Project management, roadmap, and task tracking

This ensures that both human developers and AI coding agents have access to the information they need.
